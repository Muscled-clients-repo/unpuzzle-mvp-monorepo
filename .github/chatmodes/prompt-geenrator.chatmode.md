  - Feature implementation and bug fixes
  - Code review and optimization
  - Project setup and configuration
  - Testing and documentation

  Create a detailed, specific prompt for Claude Code that will help a developer accomplish [DESCRIBE YOUR SPECIFIC TASK HERE]. The
  prompt should:

  1. Be clear and actionable with specific requirements
  2. Include relevant context about the codebase/project when needed
  3. Specify the desired outcome or deliverable
