# $2,000 Budget User Acquisition Strategy for Unpuzzle
**Maximum ROI Playbook for EdTech MVP**

*Date: January 9, 2025*  
*Budget: $2,000*  
*Goal: Maximum paid users in 30-60 days*  
*Target: 100-200 paid users at $30/month = $3,000-6,000 MRR*

---

## Executive Summary

With $2,000, **avoid traditional ads** (Facebook, Google) where EdTech CAC is $50-200. Instead, use **direct incentive strategies** that guarantee conversions. Your money should go directly to users, not ad platforms.

**Core Principle:** Every dollar should either become a user or create multiple users.

## What NOT to Do with $2K

### ❌ Avoid These Money Pits:

1. **Facebook/Instagram Ads**
   - EdTech CAC: $50-200
   - Your budget: 10-40 users max
   - High competition, low trust

2. **Google Ads**
   - "Learn coding" CPC: $5-15
   - 400 clicks = maybe 8 signups
   - Terrible ROI for bootstrap

3. **Expensive Influencers**
   - One macro-influencer: $2,000
   - No guarantee of conversion
   - Better to get 50 micro-influencers

4. **Traditional PR**
   - PR agency retainer: $2,000+/month
   - No guaranteed coverage
   - Wrong audience for MVP

5. **Paid Webinars**
   - Platform costs: $500/month
   - Low attendance without audience
   - Better to use free tools initially

└── Built-in community
```

## Final Recommendations

### With $2,000, prioritize:

1. **$1,000** - First 100 Founders campaign (guaranteed users)
2. **$600** - Micro-influencer campaigns (scalable)
3. **$400** - Reserve for what's working (double down)

### Expected outcome:
- **Month 1**: 100-200 signups, 50-100 paid
- **Month 2**: 150-250 total paid users
- **Month 3**: $4,500-7,500 MRR
- **ROI**: 200-400% in 90 days

### Remember:
- **Speed > Perfection**
- **Personal > Automated**
- **Retention > Acquisition**
- **Community > Advertising**

The key is to **move fast**, **track everything**, and **double down on what works**. Your $2,000 should be completely spent within 30 days, with clear data on what to do next.

**Start tomorrow, not next week.**
