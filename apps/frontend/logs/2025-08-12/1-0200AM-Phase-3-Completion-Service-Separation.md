# Phase 3 Completion: Service Layer Separation

**Date:** 2025-08-12  
**Time:** 02:00 AM EST  
**Status:** Phase 3 COMPLETED ✅

## Summary
Completed Phase 3 of the 2-hour refactor sprint by creating role-specific service layers. Made an important architectural decision to separate course services instead of combining them.

## Key Decision: Separate vs Combined Services

### Original Plan
The plan suggested a combined `role-aware-course-service.ts` with role switching logic.

### What We Actually Did
Created completely separate services:
- `student-course-service.ts`
- `instructor-course-service.ts`
- `student-video-service.ts`
- `instructor-video-service.ts`

### Why We Changed
After analysis, we found more differences than similarities:
- Different data access patterns (enrolled vs owned)
- Different methods entirely (learn vs manage)
- Different enrichment data (progress vs analytics)
- Clearer separation of concerns

## Files Created in Phase 3

1. **`/src/lib/api-client.ts`**
   - Base HTTP client with mock data support
   - Generic methods for GET, POST, PUT, DELETE
   - Environment-based switching

2. **`/src/services/student-video-service.ts`**
   - Student video operations
   - Reflection management
   - Quiz submission
   - AI chat integration

3. **`/src/services/instructor-video-service.ts`**
   - Instructor video analytics
   - Student activity tracking
   - Response system
   - Confusion hotspot management

4. **`/src/services/student-course-service.ts`** (Separated)
   - Enrolled courses
   - Learning progress
   - Course enrollment
   - Certificate retrieval

5. **`/src/services/instructor-course-service.ts`** (Separated)
   - Course creation/management
   - Analytics and revenue
   - Student submissions
   - Announcements

6. **`/src/services/role-services.ts`**
   - Central export file
   - Clean imports for components

## Discovery: Old Service Still in Use

Found that `src/services/course-service.ts` (old architecture) is still being used by:
- `src/stores/slices/course-slice.ts`
- `src/services/index.ts`
- `src/data/repositories/course-repository.ts`

This will be addressed in Phase 4 when updating stores to use new services.

## Updated Documentation

- ✅ Updated `2-hour-refactor-sprint-REVISED.md` with completion status
- ✅ Added Step 4.0 to Phase 4 about updating old service usage
- ✅ Created comprehensive Phase 3 documentation in `06-phase-3-role-specific-services.md`

## Next Steps: Phase 4

Split video store into student/instructor slices and update existing stores to use new services. This includes:
1. Update `course-slice.ts` to use new services
2. Create role-specific store slices
3. Remove old `course-service.ts` after migration

## Architecture Impact

The service layer is now:
- **More maintainable** - Each service has single responsibility
- **Type-safe** - Using domain types from `/types/domain.ts`
- **Role-aware** - Clear separation between roles
- **Mock-ready** - Easy switch between mock and real data
- **Scalable** - Easy to add new role-specific methods

## Commit Information
- Commit ID: `38dcdf2`
- Message: "refactor: organize video players by role and create domain types"
- Files changed: 20 files
- Note: Services created but not yet committed separately
