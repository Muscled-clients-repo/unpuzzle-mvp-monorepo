#### Commit: `32f6713`
**Date:** 2025-08-12  
**Message:** docs: add comprehensive route and component analysis documentation

**Details:**
- **Documentation Created:**
  - Complete route list with actual example URLs for all 34 routes
  - Unused Zustand store analysis identifying ui-slice as completely unused
  - Feature removal strategy for non-MVP features
  - Component dependency analysis for unneeded routes
  
- **Key Findings:**
  - Identified 7 routes to be removed: /alt, /student/community, /instructor/promote, /api/youtube-transcript, and test routes
  - All components are shared between needed/unneeded routes (no component deletion needed)
  - Community slice only used by /student/community route
  - UI slice completely unused (100 lines of dead code)
  
- **Route ID Corrections:**
  - Fixed instructor course routes to use numeric IDs (/instructor/course/1/analytics)
  - Documented lesson routes use lesson-prefixed IDs (/instructor/lesson/lesson-1/analytics)
  - Student routes keep course-prefixed IDs (/student/course/course-1/video/1)
