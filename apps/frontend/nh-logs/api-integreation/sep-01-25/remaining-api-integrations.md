‚ùå DELETE /api/v1/content/sections/{id}/             - Delete section
```

## üü° HIGH PRIORITY - Features with Existing UI

### 5. AI Agents in Video Player (Mostly Working)
**Current State:** Hint and Quiz agents confirmed working ‚úÖ, others need verification
**User Impact:** Core AI learning features functional
```
‚úÖ POST /api/v1/ai-assistant/agents/hint/            - Generate learning hints (WORKING)
‚úÖ POST /api/v1/ai-assistant/agents/quiz/            - Generate quiz questions (WORKING)
‚ùì POST /api/v1/ai-assistant/agents/reflect/         - Reflection agent (needs testing)
‚ùì POST /api/v1/ai-assistant/agents/path/            - Learning path agent (needs testing)
```

### 6. Student Analytics Dashboard
**Current State:** Full UI at `/instructor/course/[id]/analytics` using mock data
**User Impact:** Instructors cannot see real course analytics
```
‚ùå GET  /api/v1/instructor/courses/{id}/analytics    - Course analytics
‚ùå GET  /api/v1/instructor/courses/{id}/students     - Course student list
‚ùå POST /api/v1/instructor/courses/{id}/analytics/export - Export analytics
```

### 7. Student Engagement Tracking
**Current State:** UI at `/instructor/engagement` using mock data
**User Impact:** Cannot track real student engagement
```
‚ùå GET  /api/v1/instructor/engagement/journeys       - Student learning journeys

## Implementation Recommendations

### Phase 1 - Fix Non-Functional UI (Week 1)
1. **Student Management APIs** - Make instructor dashboard functional
2. **Confusion/Reflection Response** - Enable instructor responses
3. **Lesson Publishing** - Complete lesson creation flow
4. **Course Sections** - Organize content properly

### Phase 2 - Complete Existing Features (Week 2)
1. **AI Agents in Video** - Connect hint/quiz buttons to backend
2. **Analytics Dashboard** - Replace mock data with real metrics
3. **Student Engagement** - Real activity tracking

### Phase 3 - Enhancement (Week 3)
1. **Student Reflections Page** - Add AI insights
2. **Email Verification** - Fix resend functionality
3. **Media Library** - Complete upload management

## Quick Implementation Guide

### Priority Order for Implementation:
1. **First**: APIs for features with complete UI but mock data
2. **Second**: APIs for features with buttons that don't work
3. **Third**: APIs for features partially implemented

### Service File Template:
```typescript
// Example: instructor-service.ts
export const getStudentInsights = async (
  studentId: string
): Promise<StudentInsights> => {
  const response = await apiClient.get(
    `/api/v1/instructor/students/${studentId}/insights`
  );
  return response.data;
};
```

## Summary

### Features with UI but Missing APIs:
- **7 Critical Features** - Complete UI, non-functional
- **4 High Priority Features** - UI ready, not connected
- **3 Medium Priority Features** - Partial UI implementation

### Total Missing Endpoints for Existing UI:
- **Student Management**: 4 endpoints
- **Confusion/Reflection**: 4 endpoints
- **Lesson Creation**: 4 endpoints
- **Course Sections**: 5 endpoints
- **AI Agents**: 2 endpoints (hint & quiz working)
- **Analytics**: 3 endpoints
- **Engagement**: 3 endpoints
- **Other**: 3 endpoints
- **Total**: ~28 endpoints needed for existing UI

## Next Steps

1. **Immediate**: Connect student management APIs (instructor dashboard)
2. **This Week**: Fix all non-functional buttons and forms
3. **Testing**: Verify each connection with real backend data

## Note on Excluded Features

The following were excluded because they have **no UI implementation**:
- Payment history page
- Subscription management page
- Notification center
- OAuth account linking page
- Certificate generation
- Course reviews display
- Session management
- Billing/invoice pages

These features should be added to the UI first before their APIs are integrated.
