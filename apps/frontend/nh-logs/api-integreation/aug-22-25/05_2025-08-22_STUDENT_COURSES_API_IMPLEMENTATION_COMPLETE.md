---

## ✅ Completed Changes

### 1. API Client Enhancement
**File**: `src/lib/api-client.ts`
- ✅ Added `getStudentCourses()` - GET enrolled courses
- ✅ Added `enrollInCourse()` - POST enrollment with payment data
- ✅ Added `unenrollFromCourse()` - POST unenrollment
- ✅ Added `getStudentCourseProgress()` - GET course progress
- ✅ Added `submitCourseReview()` - POST course review
- ✅ Using existing `credentials: 'include'` for auth
- ✅ No manual CSRF token handling needed

### 2. Service Layer Updates
**File**: `src/services/student-course-service.ts`
- ✅ Updated `getEnrolledCourses()` to use new API client method
- ✅ Updated `getCourseProgress()` to use new API client method
- ✅ Updated `enrollInCourse()` with payment data support
- ✅ Added `unenrollFromCourse()` method
- ✅ Added `submitCourseReview()` method
- ✅ Maintained mock data fallback support

### 3. Store Integration
**File**: `src/stores/slices/student-course-slice.ts`
- ✅ Added operation-specific loading states:
  - `enrollingCourseId`
  - `unenrollingCourseId`
  - `loadingProgressCourseId`
  - `submittingReviewCourseId`
- ✅ Changed `courseProgress` to Record<string, CourseProgress> for multiple courses
- ✅ Added `unenrollFromCourse()` action with optimistic updates
- ✅ Added `submitCourseReview()` action
- ✅ Updated `calculateProgress()` to use actual data
- ✅ Fixed enrollment to accept payment data

### 4. UI Component Updates
**File**: `src/app/student/courses/page.tsx`
- ✅ Removed all mock data dependencies
- ✅ Using real API progress data
- ✅ Added unenroll functionality with confirmation
- ✅ Added individual loading states per operation
- ✅ Added unenroll button with loading spinner
- ✅ Fixed progress calculations from API data
- ✅ Added formatLastAccessed helper function
- ✅ Filtered in-progress courses properly

## 🏗️ Architecture Alignment

### Followed Established Patterns:

1. **API Client Pattern**:
   - ✅ Methods added to centralized `api-client.ts`
   - ✅ Using existing auth with `credentials: 'include'`
   - ✅ No manual header management
   - ✅ CORS mode already configured

2. **Service Layer Pattern**:
   - ✅ Mock data switching preserved
   - ✅ Services call apiClient methods
   - ✅ Return `ServiceResult<T>` type
   - ✅ No direct API calls from stores

3. **Store Pattern**:
   - ✅ Operation-specific loading states
   - ✅ Optimistic updates with rollback
   - ✅ Error handling in store actions
   - ✅ Auto-refresh related data after mutations

4. **UI Pattern**:
   - ✅ Disable buttons during operations
   - ✅ Show loading spinners per operation
   - ✅ Use store loading states for UI feedback
   - ✅ Confirmation dialogs for destructive actions

## 📊 API Endpoints Integrated

| Endpoint | Method | Status | Notes |
|----------|--------|--------|-------|
| `/api/v1/student/courses` | GET | ✅ | Get enrolled courses |
| `/api/v1/student/courses/{id}/enroll` | POST | ✅ | Enroll with payment |
| `/api/v1/student/courses/{id}/unenroll` | POST | ✅ | Unenroll from course |
| `/api/v1/student/courses/{id}/progress` | GET | ✅ | Get course progress |
| `/api/v1/student/courses/{id}/review` | POST | ✅ | Submit review |

## 🔄 Data Flow

```
User Action → UI Component → Store Action → Service Layer → API Client → Backend
                    ↓                              ↓
                State Update              Response Processing
                    ↓                              ↓
                UI Re-render              Error Handling
```

## 🎨 UI Improvements

1. **Progress Display**:
   - Real-time progress percentage
   - Videos completed counter
   - Last accessed time formatting
   - Dynamic time remaining calculation

2. **User Actions**:
   - Continue learning button
   - Unenroll button with confirmation
   - Loading states per action
   - Disabled states during operations

3. **Course Filtering**:
   - All courses tab
   - In-progress courses (0% < progress < 100%)
   - Completed courses (progress = 100%)

---

## 🧪 Testing Results

### Build Test:
```bash
npm run build
✓ Compiled successfully
✓ No TypeScript errors in student course files
✓ All imports resolved correctly
```

### Functionality Verified:
- ✅ API client methods compile correctly
- ✅ Service layer methods type-safe
- ✅ Store actions properly typed
- ✅ UI components render without errors
- ✅ Mock data toggle works via env variable

---

## 🚀 Next Steps

### Immediate:
1. Test with actual backend API
2. Verify authentication flow
3. Test error scenarios

### Future Enhancements:
1. Add course review UI component
2. Implement pagination for course lists
3. Add search and filter functionality
4. Implement batch progress loading
5. Add offline support with caching

---

## 📝 Migration Notes

### For Backend Team:
- Ensure CORS is configured for credentials
- CSRF protection should be handled server-side
- Rate limiting should be implemented as per Postman specs

### For Frontend Team:
- Set `NEXT_PUBLIC_USE_MOCK_DATA=false` to use real API
- Configure `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL` with backend URL
- Test auth flow with actual cookies

---

## ⚠️ Known Limitations

1. **AI Interactions**: Currently hardcoded to 0 (needs separate API)
2. **Struggling Topics**: Currently empty array (needs analytics API)
3. **Milestones**: Basic calculation (needs course structure API)
4. **Review UI**: Backend ready but UI not implemented yet
