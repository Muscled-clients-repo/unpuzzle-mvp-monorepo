# Student Learning Routes Implementation Plan
**Date**: 2025-08-25  
**Time**: 12:20:00  
**Component**: Student Learning Experience API

## Overview

Implementation plan for student learning page routes that provide access to course content with proper enrollment verification. These routes will enable students to access course materials and track their learning progress.

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements
1. **Course & Sections Access**: Route to get course with all its sections for enrolled students
2. **Section Content Access**: Route to get specific section content by section ID 
3. **Enrollment Verification**: Both routes must verify student enrollment before granting access
4. **Access Control**: Return appropriate error if student is not enrolled
5. **Progress Tracking**: Support for tracking student progress through course content

### Non-Functional Requirements
- **Security**: JWT authentication required
- **Performance**: Efficient querying with proper serialization
- **Consistency**: Follow existing API patterns and response formats
- **Documentation**: Clear API documentation with examples

## Route Specifications

### 1. Course Learning Overview Route

**Endpoint**: `GET /api/v1/student/courses/{course_id}/learn/`

**Purpose**: Get course with all sections for the student learning page

**Authentication**: Required (JWT token)

**Request Parameters**:
- `course_id` (UUID): Course identifier

**Response Format**:
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {
    "course": {
      "id": "uuid",
      "title": "Course Title",
      "description": "Course description",
      "instructor": {...},
      "sections": [
        {
          "id": "uuid", 
          "title": "Section 1",
          "description": "Section description",
          "order": 1,
          "is_published": true,
          "media_count": 5
        }
      ]
    },
    "enrollment": {
      "enrolled_at": "2025-08-25T10:00:00Z",
      "progress_percentage": 25.5,
      "lessons_completed": 3,
      "total_lessons": 12
    }
  }
}
```

**Error Responses**:
- `401`: Authentication required
- `403`: Not enrolled in course - "Please enroll first to start learning"
- `404`: Course not found or not published

### 2. Section Content Route

**Endpoint**: `GET /api/v1/student/courses/{course_id}/sections/{section_id}/content/`

**Purpose**: Get detailed section content including media files for enrolled students

**Authentication**: Required (JWT token)

**Request Parameters**:
- `course_id` (UUID): Course identifier  
- `section_id` (UUID): Section identifier

**Response Format**:
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {
    "section": {
      "id": "uuid",
      "title": "Section Title", 
      "description": "Section description",
      "order": 1,
      "course_id": "uuid"
    },
    "media_files": [
      {
        "id": "uuid",
        "title": "Video 1",
        "file_type": "video",
        "file_url": "https://...",
        "duration": 1800,
        "order": 1,
        "is_completed": false
      }
    ],
    "progress": {
      "section_progress_percentage": 50.0,
      "completed_media": 2,
      "total_media": 4
    }
  }
}
```

**Error Responses**:
- `401`: Authentication required
- `403`: Not enrolled in course - "Please enroll first to start learning" 
- `404`: Course/section not found or not published

## Implementation Details

### Database Queries
- Verify enrollment with single query: `Enrollment.objects.filter(user=user, course=course, status='active').exists()`
- Use `select_related()` and `prefetch_related()` for efficient data loading
- Filter only published sections and media files

### Views Structure
```python
@api_view(['GET'])
def get_course_for_learning(request, course_id):
    """Get course with sections for student learning page"""
    pass

@api_view(['GET']) 
def get_section_content(request, course_id, section_id):
    """Get section content for enrolled students"""
    pass
```

### Serializers
- `CourseLearnSerializer`: Course with sections for learning page
- `SectionContentSerializer`: Section with media files and progress
- Reuse existing enrollment and media serializers where possible

### URL Patterns
```python
# In courses/urls.py - Student Learning Routes
path('student/courses/<uuid:course_id>/learn/', views.get_course_for_learning, name='course_learning'),
path('student/courses/<uuid:course_id>/sections/<uuid:section_id>/content/', views.get_section_content, name='section_content'),
```

## Security Considerations

1. **Enrollment Verification**: Always verify active enrollment before returning content
2. **Course Ownership**: Ensure section belongs to the specified course
3. **Published Content Only**: Only return published courses and sections  
4. **Rate Limiting**: Apply appropriate throttling for content access
5. **User Context**: Include user-specific progress and completion status

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests
- Test enrollment verification logic
- Test access denied scenarios
- Test data serialization correctness

### Integration Tests  
- End-to-end API testing with real database
- Authentication flow testing
- Error response validation

### Test Cases
1. **Happy Path**: Enrolled student accesses course/section content
2. **Unenrolled Access**: Non-enrolled student gets access denied
3. **Unpublished Content**: Student cannot access unpublished sections
4. **Invalid IDs**: Proper 404 responses for non-existent courses/sections
5. **Authentication**: Proper 401 responses for unauthenticated requests

## Migration Path

1. **Phase 1**: Implement basic routes with enrollment verification
2. **Phase 2**: Add progress tracking and completion status
3. **Phase 3**: Optimize queries and add caching if needed
4. **Phase 4**: Add analytics and learning metrics

## Success Criteria

- ✅ Students can access course overview with sections when enrolled
- ✅ Students can view section content with proper media files
- ✅ Unenrolled students receive clear access denied messages
- ✅ All routes properly authenticated and authorized
- ✅ Efficient database queries with minimal N+1 problems
- ✅ Consistent API response formats
- ✅ Comprehensive test coverage (>90%)

## Dependencies

- Existing `Course`, `CourseSection`, `Enrollment` models
- Media library integration for file serving
- Authentication middleware
- Progress tracking system (if not already implemented)

## Estimated Timeline

- **Planning & Design**: 0.5 days ✅
- **Implementation**: 1 day
- **Testing**: 0.5 days  
- **Documentation**: 0.25 days
- **Total**: 2.25 days

## Next Steps

1. Review plan with team
2. Implement serializers and views
3. Add URL patterns and test endpoints
4. Write comprehensive tests
5. Update API documentation
