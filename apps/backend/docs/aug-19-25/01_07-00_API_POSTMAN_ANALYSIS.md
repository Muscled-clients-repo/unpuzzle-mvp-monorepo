#### Course Management
6. **courses** - Main course information
7. **course_sections** - Course chapter/section organization
8. **videos** - Video content for courses
9. **quizzes** - Interactive quiz questions
10. **quiz_attempts** - User quiz responses

#### Learning Progress
11. **enrollments** - Course enrollment records

16. **course_recommendations** - Personalized recommendations

### 3.2 Association Tables (3 tables)
- **user_roles** - Many-to-many user-role mapping
- **user_permissions** - Direct user permissions
- **role_permissions** - Role-permission mapping

### 3.3 Key Database Features

#### Security & Audit
- All tables use UUID primary keys
- Soft delete support (deleted_at, is_deleted)
- Audit fields (created_by_id, updated_by_id, deleted_by_id)
- Optimistic locking (version field)

#### Performance
- Strategic indexes on frequently queried fields
- Composite indexes for complex queries
- JSON fields for flexible metadata storage

## 4. Key Findings and Discrepancies

### 4.1 Critical Gaps in Documentation

1. **Session Management Not Documented**
   - The API supports comprehensive session management allowing users to view and revoke sessions across devices
   - This is a critical security feature that's not reflected in the Postman collection

2. **RBAC System Partially Hidden**
   - While the implementation has robust RBAC, the Postman collection doesn't document:
     - Role checking endpoints
     - Permission verification endpoints
     - Admin role assignment capabilities

3. **Course Sections Architecture**
   - Database has `course_sections` table for organizing videos into chapters
   - API routes don't fully expose section management capabilities
   - Videos can belong to sections but this isn't reflected in the API

### 4.2 Implementation Strengths

1. **Comprehensive Security**
   - Multi-layered authentication (JWT + refresh tokens)
   - CSRF protection for state-changing operations
   - Session management across devices
   - Granular permission system

2. **Data Integrity**
   - Soft delete preserves data history
   - Audit trail tracks all modifications
   - Version control prevents concurrent update conflicts

3. **Scalability Features**
   - Efficient indexing strategy
   - JSON metadata fields for extensibility
   - Pagination support on all list endpoints

### 4.3 Rate Limiting Analysis

| Operation Type | Rate Limit | Adequacy |
|---------------|------------|----------|
| Authentication | 5-30/min | ‚úÖ Appropriate |
| Read Operations | 100/min | ‚úÖ Good for browsing |
| Video Progress | 500/min | ‚úÖ Excellent for real-time updates |
| Write Operations | 10-50/min | ‚úÖ Prevents abuse |
| File Uploads | 10-20/min | ‚úÖ Reasonable for instructors |
| Account Deletion | 1/hour | ‚úÖ Strong protection |

## 5. Recommendations

2. **Materialized Views**: Create views for complex aggregations (course statistics)
3. **Archival Strategy**: Move old audit logs to archive tables
4. **Read Replicas**: Implement read/write splitting for scalability

## 8. API Design Patterns Analysis

### RESTful Compliance
- ‚úÖ Proper HTTP methods usage
- ‚úÖ Resource-based URLs
- ‚úÖ Stateless authentication
- ‚úÖ Consistent naming conventions

### Areas for Improvement
1. **HATEOAS**: Add hypermedia links for discoverability
2. **Pagination**: Standardize cursor-based pagination
3. **Filtering**: Implement GraphQL-like field selection
4. **Versioning**: Add version in headers instead of URL

## 9. Conclusion

The Unpuzzle MVP backend demonstrates a robust and well-architected system with comprehensive features beyond what's documented in the Postman collection. The implementation includes advanced security features, comprehensive audit trails, and a flexible database schema that supports future growth.

### Key Strengths
- Solid authentication and authorization system
- Comprehensive progress tracking
- AI-ready architecture
- Excellent database design with proper indexing

### Primary Areas for Improvement
- Documentation gaps need to be addressed
- Section management API should be exposed
